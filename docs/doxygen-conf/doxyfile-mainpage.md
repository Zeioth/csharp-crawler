Introduction {#mainpage}
============

Google Play Tools is the code name we've choose for this set of clients, 
that allow us to automatically search and extract information from Google Playstore 
and store it in our database. Right now, you can parse apps, reviews, users anonymous data, 
and top rankings. Also you can perform other tasks like clear old apps, 
or update apps information periodically. You can also configure a great amount of setting by passing 
params to any application. For more information use:

> mono GooglePlay-Crawler.exe --help

There's at least three things you must see here:

- [The project wiki](wiki.htm)
- [Class diagram](inherits.html)
- [Class list](annotated.html)

Also, be aware that all clients share the same architecture.
